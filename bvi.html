					<h3 id="relaxTitle1">Anegada:</h3>
					<p id="relaxText1">The northernmost island inthe BVIs, Anegada takes "island time" to a whole new level.  Lounge beach-side during the day, and dine on fresh caught lobster at night.  Our favorite places were Wonky Dog &amp; Cow Wreck Beach.</p>

					<p id="relaxText2">This may just be te best place on earth. Bitter End is a quaint resort-turned-town, featuring several restaurants and high-end beaches. While staying at the resort is extremely expensive, the mooring fee is nominal and comes with full resort access.</p>

					<h3 id="rageTitle1">The Soggy Dollar Bar:</h3>
					<p id="rageText1">The original 'beach-bar' of the BVIs, Soggy Dollar got it's name because you can only get to the bar by swimming there from your anchored boat.  No roads, no docks, just a small bar on a stretch of beach that hosts amazing day-parties.</p>
					<h3 id="rageTitle2">Willy T's:</h3>

					<h3 id="randomTitle1">Insider Tips:</h3>
					<p id="randomText1">There's only one way to experience BVI: by boat.  It's cheaper, easier to get around, and way mroe fun than staying at a hotel.  Catamarans are better than monohauls, and can be rented from Footloose charters.</p>
					<h3 id="randomTitle2">What To Pack:</h3>
					<p id="randomText2">Pack all your clothes in a large 90L dufle, as hard-shell suitcases take up too much room.  You'll want to pack light, and no fancy clothes -- everywhere in BVI is laid-back casual. </p>
					<h3 id="randomTitle3">What You'll Spend:</h3>
					<p id="randomText3">Flights from DC will run about $700, and boat rental will be about $700-$1k per person, per week.</p>
