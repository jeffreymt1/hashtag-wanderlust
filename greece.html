					<h3 id="roamTitle1">Mykonos:</h3> 
					<p id="roamText1">Mykonos is a beautiful, luxurious island by day, and a huge party by night.  Expect to 'disco' until 4am and nurse your hangover on a beach the next morning.</p>
					<h3 id="roamTitle2">Naxos:</h3> 
					<p id="roamText2">Naxos is a quaint island with beautiful coastlines.  There's not many clubs here, but there is a beautiful "Old Town" that features some of the best restaurants Greece has to offer.</p>
					<h3 id="roamTitle3">Paros:</h3> 
					<p id="roamText3">Paros is one of the quietest islands in the Cyclades, most popularly known for their white-wine. The best thing to do is dine ocean-side, under the stars, with a traditional glass from Moraitis Winery.</p>

				<h class="todoTitle">RELAX:</h><br>
					<h3 id="relaxTitle1">Agia Anna Beach, Mykonos:</h3>
					<p id="relaxText1">One of the few "quiet beaches" in Mykonos, Agia Anna is a white-sand beach complete with loungers and private villas complete with beverage service. </p>
					<h3 id="relaxTitle2">Agio Prokopios, Naxos:</h3>
					<p id="relaxText2">If you're going to sail Naxos, you need to anchor at Agio Prokopios.  This inlet is perfect for lounging on a raft and soaking up the Mediterranean sun.</p>
					<h3 id="relaxTitle3">Amfigeio, Anti Paros:</h3>
					<p id="relaxText3">While you can only visit by boat, the straight between Paros and Anti Paros is heavon on earth.  The waters here are as calm as glass and the coastline is littered with secluded 'urchen caves' and grottos.</p>

					<h3 id="rageTitle1">Skandinavian Bar, Mykonos:</h3>
					<p id="rageText1">This is THE best bar in old-town Mykonos. The bar is packed 24/7, but the bar turns to a disco around mid-night with DJs playing well into the next morning.</p>
					<h3 id="rageTitle2">Tropicana Beach Bar, Mykonos</h3>
					<p id="rageText2">This beach-bar is best known for being the pre-party for Paradise beach, but it's a must-do destination on it's own.  Featuring multiple open-air discos along the beach, DJs start early and play late.</p>
					<h3 id="rageTitle3">Paradise Club, Mykonos:</h3>
					<p id="rageText3">Located on Paradise Beach, the most iconic beaches in Greece, Paradise Club is the largest and most famous nightclub on the island of Mykonos. Expect to party all night, and well into the next morning.</p>

				<h class="todoTitle">RANDOM:</h><br>
					<h3 id="randomTitle1">Insider Tips:</h3>
					<p id="randomText1">If you are visiting the Cyclades by boat, ferry from Athens to Mykonos and rent a boat in Mykonos.  It'll give you a day to see Athens and save you a ton of time and money.</p>
					<h3 id="randomTitle2">What To Pack:</h3>
					<p id="randomText2">Greece is casual by day, but quite fancy at night.  This is especially true in Mykonos, so pack high-end, lightweight clothing. </p>
					<h3 id="randomTitle3">What You'll Spend:</h3>
					<p id="randomText3">Flights from DC to Athens will cost you around $1,200.  You'll spend another $900 on a boat, and $100 in ferry transfers.</p>
