					<h3 id="roamTitle1">Golden Circle:</h3>
					<p id="roamText1">Probably the best tour in Iceland is the "Golden Circle Super Jeep Tour."  Jump in a lifted jeep and roam around nature geysers, fault lines, and multiple waterfalls. </p>
					<h3 id="roamTitle2">South Coast:</h3>
					<p id="roamText2">If you truely want to experience the vast nature wonders that Iceland has to offer, the South Coast is your ideal tour.  Visit black sand beaches, glaciers, and several waterfalls that you can hike and even walk behind.</p>
					<h3 id="roamTitle3">The Red Hill Area:</h3>
					<p id="roamText3">For a unique and more traditional icelandic tour, try horse riding along the Red Hill area.  Here you'll ride the famous Icelandic Horses around ancient volcanic ash mountains.</p>

				<h class="todoTitle">RELAX:</h><br>
					<h3 id="relaxTitle1">The Blue Lagoon:</h3>
					<p id="relaxText1">The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa just outside of Reykjavik's main airport.  It is the most visited attractions in Iceland for a reason -- this extravagant spa is located in a lava field, set in the pure heart of the Icelandic landscape.</p>
					<h3 id="relaxTitle2">The Harpa:</h3>
					<p id="relaxText2">The Harpa is a famous concert hall in Reykjavík, best known for it's "fish scale" glass exterior.  While the building itself is beautiful, the best way to experiene The Harpa is through their lesser known "food tastin" tour.</p>
					<h3 id="relaxTitle3">Hallgrímskirkja, Church:</h3>
					<p id="relaxText3">Situated in the centre of Reykjavík, Hallgrímskirkja is one of the city's best-known landmarks and is visible throughout the city. Visit here to take-in the beautiful cathedral and experience the best views of the city from the Church's bell tower.</p>

				<h class="todoTitle">RAGE:</h><br>
					<h3 id="rageTitle1">Lebowski Bar:</h3>
					<p id="rageText1">Enjoy Reykjavik nightlife at Lebowski Bar, which offers 16 different kinds of White Russian, wheel of fortune and a DJ playing all night long. And yes, the inside is decorated just like the movie The Big Lebowski. But note: any aggression will not stand, man.</p>
					<h3 id="rageTitle2">Austur:</h3>
					<p id="rageText2">This is probably the best club in downtown Reykjavík -- great DJs, decently priced bottle service, and there's even a coat check (which is clutch in Iceland). While all night are fun, their best DJs usually play Friday.</p>
					<h3 id="rageTitle3">B5:</h3>
					<p id="rageText3">This is the "clubbiest club" in Iceland.  Raging house music, tons of squished people dancing, and with almost all locals this isn't your average toursit spot.  Go here if you want to party all night.</p>

					<h3 id="randomTitle1">Insider Tips:</h3>
					<p id="randomText1">If you want to try and see the Northern Lights, do a tour your first night.  This way if the weather is bad you can  rechedule another tour later in your stay at no additional cost!</p>
					<h3 id="randomTitle2">What To Pack:</h3>
					<p id="randomText2">Yes Iceland is cold, but most importantly it is also very, very wet. Buy and wear waterproof everything - shoes, pants, jacket, etc.  Also, umbrella's are pointless due to the strong Icelandic winds, so bring a waterproof hat too!</p>
					<h3 id="randomTitle3">What You'll Spend:</h3>
					<p id="randomText3">The best thing to do is to book a "package" that includes flight, hotel, and multiple tours.  The best site to check for deals is <a id="travelzoo" href="https://www.travelzoo.com/">TravelZoo</a>, with 4-day packages starting at $800 per person.</p>
